            Its the website you are currently viewing.This website gives a little brief about me. 
            Its an attempt to describe who I am and what I do.
            <br />            
            This projects help me enhance my front end skills. As a Full-Stack Developer 
            I must have good front end capacity along with some UI/UX understaing.
            With this project I am exploring react. It also helps me understand responsive web design.
          </p>

            This website is completely responsive and works flawlessly on any screen size.
